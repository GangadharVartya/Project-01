# About the dataset

The data set generated by IndPenSim represents the biggest data set available for advanced
data analytics and contains 100 batches with all the available processes and Raman
spectroscopy measurements (~2.5 GB size). The 100 batches are controlled using different
control strategies and different batch lengths representing a typical Biopharmaceutical
manufacturing facility:
● Batches 1-30: Controlled by recipe driven approach
● Batches 31-60: Controlled by operators
● Batches 61-90: Controlled by an Advanced Process Control (APC) solution using the
Raman spectroscopy.
● Batches 91:100: Contain faults resulting in process deviations
Penicillin concentration plays a vital role in the Penicillin fermentation process. Therefore, in
this project, we aim at developing an inferential model to predict the penicillin concentration
for the batches 31-60 which are controlled by operators.

#Objectives

● To identify the relevant input variables to predict the penicillin concentration (the
considered quality variable).
● Develop regression models to predict the penicillin concentration.
● Evaluate the performance of different models
● Discuss on the selection of hyperparameters (wherever applicable).
● Suggest a suitable model for predicting the penicillin concentration.

#Conclusion

A dataset generated from the industrial penicillin fermentation process was
considered. Out of the dataset batches 31-60 which were controlled by operators were
considered for predicting the value of the quality variable which was Penicillin concentration
for our case. As the dataset was labeled and the desired value had to be predicted such that it
is numeric in nature. Hence, the problem was a supervised learning regression problem. The
relevant input variables were identified and Machine Learning models were developed based
on the considered dataset. Different linear and polynomial models were trained and tested.
The Gradient boosted regressor which uses a tree-based algorithm has shown the best
performance amongst them.
